### This repository is meant to collaborate on various directions in the AI research space and produce research paper work for the wider research community.

As of now, we've been exploring the current ideas:
- [ ] Review paper on Evaluation of AI models (Evals)
- [ ] Create and publish a new benchmark for something novel science discovery (NSD Bench)
- [ ] Review paper on Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- [ ] LLM Unlearning / Mechanistic Interpretability
- [ ] Training small models (SLM) for Agentic Tool calling
- [ ] RL to jailbreak other models

We've started work on the first idea direction. Research work, papers to read, things to do & relevant updates will be logged here.
